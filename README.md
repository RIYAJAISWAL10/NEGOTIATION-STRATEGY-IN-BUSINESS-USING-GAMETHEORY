# 🤝 Negotiation in Business Strategy Using Game Theory

## 📘 Overview

This project presents a smart solution to simulate and analyze negotiation strategies in business using the principles of Game Theory. By modeling business interactions between decision-makers as strategic games, this tool helps identify optimal strategies through Nash Equilibrium. Implemented using Python and Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface and visual outputs for practical application.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate strategic negotiations between two or more business players.
- Apply Game Theory models (Non-Cooperative Games, Nash Equilibrium).
- Evaluate different strategies using pure and mixed probability models.
- Visualize results using probability graphs and decision matrices.
- Offer a GUI-based interactive tool using Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Nashpy** – Game Theory solver library
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization
- **Streamlit** – Web app interface
- **Excel Solver** – Used for external validation

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RIYAJAISWAL10/NEGOTIATION-STRATEGY-IN-BUSINESS-USING-GAMETHEORY.git
cd NEGOTIATION-STRATEGY-IN-BUSINESS-USING-GAMETHEORY
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py

📊 Features
Strategy input from both players (e.g., price negotiation, resource allocation)

Nash equilibrium computation

Visualization of strategy probability distributions

Excel Solver comparison

Robust error handling and input validation

🧪 Sample Output
Pure Strategy: Both players have only one optimal choice.

Mixed Strategy: Players use a probability distribution over strategies.

Visual Graph: Probability bar chart showing strategic choices.
